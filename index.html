        <h1>Hello! I'm Cindy Liang</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a senior year transfer student majoring in Information Science and Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>
        
        <p>As a Taiwanese student, I bring a unique perspective to my studies and projects. I am fascinated by how technology can bridge gaps and foster understanding across cultures. I enjoy exploring innovative ways to analyze and present data, transforming it into actionable insights.</p>

        <p>I love diving into novels that transport me to different worlds and perspectives. Literature inspires my creativity and helps me think critically, skills that are invaluable in my studies and future career. I also enjoy engaging with narratives that highlight social issues, as they deepen my understanding of the human experience.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my studies, I am passionate about exploring how data can be used to enhance our understanding of the world around us. Whether it's through statistical analysis or visual storytelling, I aim to leverage my skills to make a positive impact.</p>
